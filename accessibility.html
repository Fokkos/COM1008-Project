                For all images on the website, we are going to 
                include alternative text that will be readable to screen 
                readers. This means that users who are visually impaired will be 
                able to access the website and get all of the information that a 
                user with full vision would be able to.</p>

                dyslexia-friendly fonts (Arial for paragraph text and Verdana 
                for Headers) so that any dyslexic user will have minimal issues

                use of the ALT button to access every element (excluding the JS 
                game as canvas cannot be made to do that). This means that users 
                who cannot use mice will have the full experience.</p>

            <p class="contentP">The website will include a toggle-able dark mode 
                which will change the colours of the website to a more dark 
                tone. It reduces any eye-straining bright light and means that 
                users in low-light situations will be able to see the website 
                easier. You can try it out by clicking the crescent icon in
                the top right of the page!</p>
