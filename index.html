        I was going for. The compromise for this is that you can only have

                James' Games is a small indie web-based game 
                development company based in Sheffield in the United Kingdom. 
                Founded in 2021 by James March and Daniel Hebert, we aim to 
                develop games for younger generations to assist with learning, 
                particularly when it comes to vocabulary and pattern 
                recognition.<br><br>
                
                We are a small team currently consisting of 3 members and have 
                been working as a team on many projects, one of them being 
                publicly available. We are a creative group with plenty of ideas 
                for projects going forward and look to keep working our goals 
                and plans throughout the next few years..<br><br>

                As a group, we are looking forward to everyone being able to get 
                their hands on our new releases when they release and cannot 
                wait to hear feedback from everyone and keep working on what 
                makes us successful.

                Our primary focus as a company is creating simple JavaScript 
                games, primarily and firstly built for mobile devices. The games 
                are all simple and lightweight meaning that all games can run on 
                almost every device as well as meaning that the games do not 
                require a lot of internet usage so works well if you have datacaps 
                or any other limiting factors.<br><br>

                Our main ain with these games is to provide a simple and easy 
                way for parents, teachers or even children themselves to have a 
                simple, accessible and engaging way to learn on their mobile or 
                desktop devices, all from within whatever web browser they 
                happen to use. Whilst simple, the games offer an intuative way 
                to learn shapes and animals and much more (in the future!) all 
                without having to download any additional applications.<br><br>

                An example of the products that we aim to build can be found on 
                our Game Demo page which is a simple 
                JavaScript canvas game where a user must input their name, and 
                then must select from the items desiplayed on the canvas the 
                corresponding item that the user is asked to. With this game the 
                user can learn different shapes, animals, hand-eye coordination 
                as well as a simple positive feedback loop. 
                We hope that anyone using our products enjoys themselves and we 
                welcome any feedback through our 
                contact page!
