                Today marks one of the most important steps in our company's 
                history, as we are almost at the stage of finally hitting the 
                figurative "Go live" button for our first game project, the 
                image matching game! After days of work and struggling through 
                the intricacies and technicalities of the JavaScript canvas and 
                hours upon hours of debugging, account for every scenario, we 
                finally feel as though the game is in a state where we are 
                confident to release it into the world.<br><br>

                alt="Screenshot of our game" class="rightImage"/>

                Please note that we still have a few more days of extensive 
                testing and optimizing to perform, and to ensure a flawless 
                launch, but we are incredibly excited and thankful for all the 
                hard work that you guys have put into this amazing project, and 
                look forward to seeing your feedback as we go live.<br><br>
                
                Personally, the feeling of finally publicly releasing our first 
                project as we exit Beta-Testing, the start of the next step, 
                feels like a rite of passage for us. We  look forward to meeting 
                new people, gaining the support of the amazing community, and 
                releasing our first game into the world.<br><br>
                
                We cant thank everyone that has supported us up to this point 
                enough, in particular our staff members Alex and Kit for the 
                countless hours of dev-time that they have put in to making sure 
                that our games have the smoothest and most enjoyable launch 
                possible, and a huge shoutout to our many followers and the 
                countless messages of support that have inspired us to push 
                through and make games in the first place.<br><br>
                
                Here's to the beginning of an amazing journey!<br><br>

            <h1 class="contentH1">Meet our new staff member...</h1>
            <p class="contentP">
                Today is a landmark day for James' Games as a company, as we 
                expand our workforce 50%, going from a two to three staff. At 
                the forefront of this is our new lead designer, Sam Forward.<br>
                <br>

                <img src="./media/news/samNews.jpg" alt="Photo of Sam Forward" 
                class="leftImage"/>

                As a fan of his previous work, the natural step for James was to 
                choose Sam to lead our efforts as a designer and lead the 
                expansion of the production and delivery of the company. Sam is 
                not only a talented designer, but is a seasoned producer with 
                years of experience in working with large and complex 
                development studios.<br><br>
                
                "I have no doubt that as Sam is exactly what we have been 
                lacking, and can help add a visual flare to our projects that 
                you just wouldn't get with our other staff members, as the other 
                two of us are just programmers" founder James said, and it is 
                this experience that really shows promise for the future of the 
                company. The workflow can be improved and made more efficent and 
                so more and more games can look to be produced.<br><br>
                
                In other news, the paper work has been completed and we're now 
                past the design phase for our first game. The company will be 
                using JavaScript produce games to completion. Many of the art 
                assets have been created already and they couldnt be happier 
                with where they are on the production pipeline now that this new 
                staff member has been hired.<br><br>
                
                Make sure to follow the teams social media accounts to keep 
                track of where we are in our release schedule and keep your eyes 
                posted for projects in the near future, we as a team cannot wait 
                to show you what we have in store for you all.<br><br>

                James' Games has been founded and we couldn't be more excited to 
                open our doors to the internet community. We're thrilled to 
                offer a fantastic alternative to traditional learning games 
                and provide a service and product that you can't find anywhere 
                else.<br><br>
                
                We are currently knee deep in developing a remarkable range of 
                learning games, specifically tailored for children who are just 
                starting their learning adventure. You'll find an engaging mix 
                of games such as our image selection game where players get to 
                choose from a selection of images and aim to choose the correct 
                option, and recieve feedback based on how they do.<br><br>
                
                We are a small team of two members and setting up this venture 
                has been a real challenge but it is with pride that we can 
                finally endeavour on this journey. Our pride comes with learning 
                how to release an app into the world!<br><br>
                
                Whilst creating the desktop version of our first game, we 
                realised that it was not going to be enough and required 
                something new in order to engage the younger generations, so we 
                looked back and started over, with a mobile-first approach to 
                game development, never has learning been more accessible 
                digitally.<br><br>
                
                We look forward to seeing the response to our projects and 
                company, and cannot wait to work with clients and users in the 
                future to deliver the best products possible. <br><br>
