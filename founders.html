                James is the founder of the company and lead developer on all 
                projects (including the website you are reading right now!). 
                He is from Birmingham and an avid supporter of Aston Villa FC 
                and has always had a passion for programming and software 
                engineering. He founded the company with the aim of partially 
                creating a creative output for himself and his team as well as 
                an avenue to create educational content for early years
                students, where quality products are so vital. <br><br>

                He started programming and developing in his early teens on a 
                Raspberry Pi he purchased second hand from his local computer 
                shop. He went on to attend King Edward VI Five Ways from which 
                he graduated with sufficient A-Levels to enter the University of 
                Sheffield, furthering his interest in computer science and 
                mathematics as well as giving an avanue to creatively express 
                himself.<br><br>

                After the COVID-19 outbreak in 2020, he worked for several 
                different companies, amongst them Royal Mail, Uber and the 
                Birmingham based East Asian restaurant Blue Piano. During this 
                time of uncertainty, he also spent much time refining his own 
                programming skills, learning to program in C# and developing 
                game projects, which was the basis for his desire to create 
                educational games in JavaScript.<br><br>

                He is very excited about the future of this company and 
                considers his main mission to create modern educational software 
                for children of all ages and for the general public. As the lead 
                programmer and founder of the company, his involvement in 
                projects is major and so he wishes that his contributions can be 
                successful and cannot wait for people to try his programs.

                is a massive fan of cats and simulation-style video games, 
                aiming to someday move on and produce / create his own. He was 
                one of the founding members of the company and has put time and 
                passion into making his dream a reality.<br><br>

                with James and eventually moved on to doing a BTEC in Game 
                Design at Access Creative College in Digbeth, which is hwere he 
                found his passion of designing  intricate systems and elements 
                regarding games in general. He took this passion further by

                his hobby to allow him to be creative. and takes this energy 
                forward to make new art, tools and projects in the future. He 
                also tries to build on his talents and implement this in the 
                company where he is able to.<br><br>

                Upon meeting James and giving him a quick tour of what skills he 
                had to offer, they both agreed to start up the company together 
                and have been working on education projects and products ever 
                since.
